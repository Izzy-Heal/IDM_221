    <h1 class="center">About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am a 20-year-old  Interactive Digital Media major at Drexel University. I was born and raised in Philadelphia. I have always had a passion for art and design. My mother would take me to the Philadelphia Museum of art often and I would always marvel at the things people could create. I spent my first year and a quarter at Drexel studying Computer Science. I realized in the fall of my sophomore year that Computer Science was not a major that I could create and be creative in the same way that I have always been interested in and enjoyed doing.

        I love to draw and create illustrations of characters. My illustrations are influenced by my passions, including queer cowboy culture. I also find my color sense comes from my enjoyment of fiber arts and the color selection process that goes into selecting yarns for a project. I dabble in video games but have never been very good at them wich is a shame cause they are quite fun.

        One of my main goals for my design work is to focus on accessibility within interaction design as well as creating things that are unique and beautiful. I am deeply interested in aethetics and functionality for every type of user. As a queer person I like for that part of who i am to shine in my work. I believe that recognizing the impacts that queerness brings to aethetic work is very important for what I create.
